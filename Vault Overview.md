# Welcome to Your Knowledge Vault!

This vault is designed to help you build a connected web of knowledge, particularly for learning complex, interconnected subjects like epidemiology, statistics, and mathematics.

## Core Philosophy

The structure encourages:

1.  **Atomic Notes:** Breaking down knowledge into the smallest logical units.
2.  **Rich Linking:** Connecting related atomic notes directly.
3.  **Emergent Structure:** Using Maps of Content (MOCs) for curated views.
4.  **Clear Separation:** Distinguishing between concepts, resources, and files.

## Folder Structure Overview & Usage

*   **[00 Fleeting Notes](00%20Fleeting%20Notes/README.md)**: Your inbox. See README inside for usage details.
*   **[10 Atomic Notes](10%20Atomic%20Notes/README.md)**: Core concepts. See README inside for detailed template usage and linking strategies.
*   **[20 MOCs](20%20MOCs/README.md)**: Topic overviews. See README inside for how to build effective Maps of Content.
*   **[30 Resources](30%20Resources/README.md)**: Notes *about* sources. See README inside for filling out metadata and linking to concepts/files.
*   **[40 Attachments](40%20Attachments/README.md)**: Attached files (PDFs, etc.). See README inside for configuration and best practices.
*   **[90 Meta](90%20Meta/README.md)**: Templates and internal files. See README inside for structure.

## Core Workflow

1.  **Capture:** Jot down quick ideas or raw notes in `00 Fleeting Notes`.
2.  **Process:** Regularly review Fleeting Notes. Refine ideas into one or more `10 Atomic Notes`, or merge them into existing notes. Delete temporary notes.
3.  **Elaborate & Link:** When creating/editing an Atomic Note, define the concept clearly and **link it** to other relevant Atomic Notes using `[[Wikilinks]]`.
4.  **Structure:** As a topic grows, create or update a Map of Content (MOC) in `20 MOCs`. Link relevant Atomic Notes and key Resources from the MOC.
5.  **Document Sources:** When learning from a specific source, create a note about it in `30 Resources`. Summarize, add metadata, and link to the Atomic Concepts discussed.
6.  **Attach Files:** Link the actual file (PDF, etc.) from `50 Attachments` within its corresponding note in `30 Resources`.

## Essential Plugins

*   **Templates (Core)** or **Templater (Community):** Needed to use the note templates in `90 Meta/Templates`. Configure it to use that folder.
*   **Dataview (Community):** Required for the automatic "Linked Concepts" section in the `T - Atomic Note.md` template to function.

*Feel free to adapt this structure as your needs evolve! Check the README in each folder for more specific guidance.*
