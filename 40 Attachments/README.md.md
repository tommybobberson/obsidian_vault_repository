# 40 Attachments

## Purpose

Stores all **non-Markdown files** (attachments) like PDFs and images, linked *from* your `.md` notes (primarily Resource notes).

## Contents

*   PDF files, image files, other relevant non-Markdown assets.

## Workflow & Best Practices

1.  **Configure Obsidian:** Ensure `Settings` -> `Files & Links` -> `Attachment folder path` is set correctly to `40 Attachments` (or your chosen name).
2.  **Add Files via Linking:** The best way is to **drag-and-drop** a file onto the `.md` note it relates to (usually a note in [30 Resources](../30%20Resources/README.md)). Obsidian will copy the file here and create the link automatically.
3.  **Use Clear Filenames:** Adopt a consistent naming convention *before* adding files (e.g., `AuthorYear - Short Title.pdf`).
4.  **Ensure Files are Linked:** Avoid orphaned files. Every file here should ideally be linked from at least one `.md` note.
5.  **Avoid Direct Edits Here (Usually):** Manage these files *through* Obsidian.

## Template

*   N/A (Contains actual files, not template-based Markdown notes).

## Key Connections

*   Files here are linked *from* `.md` notes elsewhere (mainly from notes in [30 Resources](../30%20Resources/README.md)).
*   Centralizes assets, keeping other folders clean.
